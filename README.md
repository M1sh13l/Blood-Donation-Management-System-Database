# Blood Donation Management System

This project presents the relational database design and SQL implementation of a **Blood Donation Management System (BDMS)**.

It models donors, recipients, blood donations, medical tests, staff members, and donation centers while ensuring referential integrity and normalized schema structure.

---

## Project Objectives

- Design a normalized relational database (up to 3NF)
- Model real-world blood donation operations
- Enforce data integrity using primary and foreign keys
- Implement constraints and relationships in SQL

---

## Database Design

### Conceptual Design
- Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD)

### Logical Design
- Relational Schema Mapping
- Primary Keys
- Foreign Keys
- Constraints (NOT NULL, UNIQUE, CHECK)

---

## Main Entities

- **Donor**
- **Recipient**
- **Blood Donation**
- **Blood Test**
- **Medical History**
- **Health Condition**
- **Staff Member**
- **Phlebotomist**
- **Blood Donation Center**
